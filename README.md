# Introduction and Context
- The code itself is a piece of a bigger project and was written in November 2021.
- Because NDAs with my current job I prefer to show this one. 
- I removed the main part of the project context so the company, purposes, users, clients and organizations will be preserved.
- I write every line, sentence, and test of this demonstration.
- The frontend is a small piece to demonstrate how to integrate with the code using ReactJS with Contexts;
- The usage of MaterialUI was to speed up the process, I am also used to working with Styled-Components and TailwindCSS

# What to expect to see
- An example of frontend code operating the system with reusable components;
- A solid backend code example with tests for the major features related to rate-policies;
- Easy to understand and readable code;

# What this project does not cover
- This is not a ready to run project; I can make a call to explain and show the entire project. Therefore, since this project was made for a company focused on debt settlement, I extracted some code aspects to demonstrate how I would organize part of a bigger proejct.
